OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
-I imported necessary modules like tkinter for creating the graphical interface and random for generating random choices. It then defines two main functions: `determine_winner()` and `on_button_click()`. 
-In the `determine_winner()` function, it randomly selects the computer's choice from 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'. It compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. It then displays the result in a message box with the choices made and the outcome.
-The `on_button_click()` function is triggered when a player clicks one of the buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). It calls the `determine_winner()` function with the choice made by the player.
-Moving on, the code sets up the main window for the game using tkinter. It customizes the window title, background color, and creates labels and buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors choices. Each button is styled with specific colors and sizes, and when clicked, it triggers the `on_button_click()` function with the corresponding choice.
-Finally, the `root.mainloop()` function runs the application, displaying the Rock-Paper-Scissors game interface and allowing players to interact with it.
